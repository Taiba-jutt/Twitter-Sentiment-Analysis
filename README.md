# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This project performs sentiment analysis on Twitter data using machine learning techniques. Tweets are classified into **positive, negative, and neutral** sentiments based on text content.

## Course Information

**Student:** Taiba Khalid
**Course:** Data Science & AI
**Semester:** 7th
**Department:** Software Engineering
**Instructor:** Dr. Mohsin Nazir

## Dataset

The dataset contains labeled Twitter tweets collected from an online source (e.g., Kaggle). Text data is preprocessed before model training.

## Methodology

* Text preprocessing (lowercasing, URL & punctuation removal, stopwords)
* Feature extraction using **TF-IDF**
* Model training:

  * Logistic Regression
  * Naive Bayes
  * Random Forest
* Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score

## Results

Logistic Regression achieved the best overall performance, showing strong accuracy and balanced F1-score compared to other models.

## Technologies

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib

## Conclusion

The project demonstrates effective sentiment classification using traditional machine learning models. Future work may include deep learning models such as LSTM or BERT.
